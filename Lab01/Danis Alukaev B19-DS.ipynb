Unfortunately, because of the process' nature, messages about different numbers were printed in one line. The reason is that several processes print to standard output at the same moment. Indeed, one can use dictionary available in `multiprocessing.Manager` to collect information about processes, but it should be passed as a second argument in `check_prime_worker` as well as the current number of workers. It violates the initial signature of `check_prime_worker`, so it makes sense to show this version independently. \\\n",

    "## Explanation of results\n",
    "Figure above shows the performance of program using different number of subprocesses in comparison with sequential processing. Notice that the runtimes of sequential and parallel program are comparable when number of subprocesses is one, so that the ratio is approximately one. In this case, creation of subprocess does not yeild any advantage over the sequential version, because all the work still treated concurrently. The time to create subprocess is negligible compared to the computations.\\\n",
    "Conversely, parallel program with more than 2 subprocesses allow to perform the work on different cores simultaneously, which leads to faster program execution. Theoretically, the maximal performance reached when number of processes is greater or equal to number of CPU cores. Apparently, computations were performed on CPU with 8 cores. The maximal ratio (syn. to maximal performance) obtained with 9 subprocesses. The reason might be the presence of different system processes that were finished when the runtime was measured for 9th processes. This also explains such a plain-like ratios' arrangement for number of processes from 3 to 8: besides this processes there were other exectuted at the same time, so that system performed swapping. Another problem affecting the performance is the presence of mutual exclusion entities used for interprocess communication.\\\n",
    "To sum up, the parallel execution tend to be desired option to choose when creating a program handling a lot of data, however the architecture of the program getting more complicated."
